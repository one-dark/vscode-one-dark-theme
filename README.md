> [One Dark](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax) theme for VS Code.

## Configuration

This theme comes with several configuration settings to allow you to customize
the theme to your preference. We currently support the following settings:

- **Italic** - When enabled, uses italic font for keywords. Note that some
  scopes \(e.g. markdown block quotes\) are styled with italic font even when
  this setting is disabled.
- **Bold** - When enabled, uses bold font for namespace, class, and function
  names. Note that some scopes \(e.g. markdown headers\) are styled with bold
  font even when this setting is disabled.

To access these configuration settings, open the VS Code settings page and
search for "One Dark".

This theme ships with the italic setting turned on by default and the other
settings turned off by default, but you can adjust the settings to any
combination you like.

## Vivid Variant

In addition to the default color pallette, this theme ships with a vivid variant
which uses the [One Dark Vivid](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-vivid-syntax)
pallette. This can be enabled by selecting "One Dark Vivid" from the Color Theme
dropdown in your VS Code settings.
